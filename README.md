## Runing / Debugging / QA

You can access the games through:

[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

You can add search query parameters to set a specific width resolution. For example, to set the width to 720 pixels, use:

[http://localhost:8080/?size=720](http://localhost:8080/?size=720)

This allows you to test your game at different resolutions easily.
